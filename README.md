# Recommending Movies from User Ratings
## I. Project Background
In this project, I train models to recommend movies for users based on their existing ratings for different movies. I use collaborative filtering methods, both model-based and memory-based. The following lists the different methods used in this project.
- Model-Based Methods
  - Alternating Least Squares ("ALS")
  - Singular Value Decomposition ("SVD")
- Memory-Based Methods
  - KNNBasic
  - KNN-w-Means
  - KNN-w-Baseline
 
## II. Data
The training is done on the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data of approximately 100,000 ratings between 1996 and 2018 for 600 users and 9,000 movies in total. Below is an excerpt of the data.
